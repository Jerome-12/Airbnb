# Airbnb Analysis
The aim of this project is to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends. The process involves:

### 1. Data Extraction:
Establish a MongoDB connection, retrieve the Airbnb dataset, and ensure efficient data retrieval for analysis.

### 2. Data Transformation:
Using Python and Pandas to clean and structure the data.

### 3. Dashboard Creation:
Using Streamlit and Plotly to build an interactive dashboard.

### 4. Analyse and Visualize the data:
   #### * Price analysis and visualization - by exploring variations based on location, property type, and seasons.
   #### * Availability patterns - by visualizing occupancy rates and demand fluctuations.
   #### * Location-based insights - by extracting and visualizing data for specific regions or neighborhoods.

### 4. Tableau Dashboard Creation.
Build a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau, combining various visualizations to present key insights from the analysis.
